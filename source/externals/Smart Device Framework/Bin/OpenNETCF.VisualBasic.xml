	<summary>
 Returns a key setting value from an application's entry in the Windows registry.
 </summary>
	<param name="AppName">Required. <see cref="T:System.String"/> expression containing the name of the application or project whose key setting is requested.</param>
	<param name="Section">Required. <see cref="T:System.String"/> expression containing the name of the section in which the key setting is found.</param>
	<param name="Key">Required. <see cref="T:System.String"/> expression containing the name of the key setting to return.</param>
	<param name="Default">Optional. Expression containing the value to return if no value is set in the Key setting. If omitted, Default is assumed to be a zero-length string ("").</param>

	<remarks>If any of the items named in the <b>GetSetting</b> arguments do not exist, <b>GetSetting</b> returns a value of <paramref name="Default"/>.
 <para><b>GetSetting</b> requires that a user be logged on since it operates under the HKEY_LOCAL_USER registry key, which is not active until a user logs on interactively.</para>
		<para>Registry settings that are to be accessed from a non-interactive process (such as mtx.exe) should be stored under either the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ or the HKEY_USER\DEFAULT\Software registry keys.</para>

	<summary>
 Saves or creates an application entry in the Windows registry.
 </summary>
	<param name="AppName">Required. String expression containing the name of the application or project to which the setting applies.</param>
	<param name="Section">Required. String expression containing the name of the section in which the key setting is being saved.</param>
	<param name="Key">Required. String expression containing the name of the key setting being saved.</param>
	<param name="Setting">Required. Expression containing the value to which Key is being set.</param>
	<remarks>
 The SaveSetting function adds the key to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings.
 <para>If the key setting can't be saved for any reason, an error occurs.</para>

	<summary>
 Deletes a section or key setting from an application's entry in the Windows registry.
 </summary>
	<param name="AppName">Required. String expression containing the name of the application or project to which the section or key setting applies.</param>
	<param name="Section">Required. String expression containing the name of the section from which the key setting is being deleted. If only AppName and Section are provided, the specified section is deleted along with all related key settings.</param>
	<param name="Key">Optional. String expression containing the name of the key setting being deleted.</param>
	<remarks>
 If all arguments are provided, the specified setting is deleted. A run-time error occurs if you attempt to use DeleteSetting on a nonexistent section or key setting.
 <para>DeleteSetting requires that a user be logged on since it operates under the HKEY_LOCAL_USER registry key, which is not active until a user logs on interactively.</para>

	<example>The following example first uses the <see cref="M:OpenNETCF.VisualBasic.Interaction.SaveSetting"/> procedure to make entries in the Windows registry for the MyApp application, and then uses the <b>DeleteSetting</b> function to remove them.
 Because no Key argument is specified, the whole Startup section is deleted, including the section name and all of its keys.
 <code>[VB]
 ' Place some settings in the registry.
 SaveSetting("MyApp", "Startup", "Top", "75")
 SaveSetting("MyApp","Startup", "Left", "50")
 
 ' Remove section and all its settings from registry.
 DeleteSetting ("MyApp", "Startup")
 ' Remove MyApp from the registry.
 DeleteSetting ("MyApp")

	<example>This example uses the <b>FileCopy</b> function to copy one file to another.
 For purposes of this example, assume that SRCFILE is a file containing some data.
 <code>[VB]
 Dim SourceFile, DestinationFile As String
 SourceFile = "SRCFILE"   ' Define source file name.
 DestinationFile = "DESTFILE"   ' Define target file name.
 FileCopy(SourceFile, DestinationFile)   ' Copy source to target.

	<example>This example uses the FileDateTime function to determine the date and time a file was created or last modified.
 The format of the date and time displayed is based on the locale settings of your system.
 <code>[VB]
 Dim MyStamp As Date
 ' Assume TESTFILE was last modified on October 12, 2001 at 4:35:47 PM.
 ' Assume English/U.S. locale settings.

 </summary>
	<param name="PathName">String expression that specifies a file. Pathname may include the directory or folder, and the drive.</param>
	<returns>The length of a file in bytes.</returns>
	<remarks>

	<example>This example uses the FileLen function to return the length of a file in bytes.

	<summary>
 Renames a disk file, directory, or folder.

	<param name="NewPath">Required. String expression that specifies the new file name and location. NewPath may include directory or folder, and drive of the destination location. The file name specified by NewPath can't already exist.</param>
	<remarks>
 The Rename function renames a file and moves it to a different directory or folder, if necessary.
 The Rename function can move a file across drives, but it can only rename an existing directory or folder when both NewPath and OldPath are located on the same drive.
 Name cannot create a new file, directory, or folder.
